0.5------------
Government rework:
-- A separate Legislature exists in constitutional monarchies and republics. It is elected depending on your voting franchise and checks the power of the sovereign/executive, voting on most issues.
-- The voting system now has much more input from its constituents. For example, a landed system will allow all landed vassals to choose a candidate, while universal suffrage looks at individual counties for party support.
-- Political parties now possess a set of "issues" that determine how members vote on certain decisions. Ideologies making up parties are now much more flexible and unique in every country, and may change in certain conditions.
-- A new Supreme Court system resolves faction disputes in republics, by the pen rather than by the sword.
