 bm_victoria:0 "The Grand Campaign"
 bm_victoria_desc:1 "These are tumultuous times. In Greece and Belgium, nationalist revolts have cracked the status quo set by the Congress of Vienna. In France, the Bourbons have been deposed, replaced by a liberal constitutional monarchy, while Austria eyes its Hungarian minority with increasing suspicion. In Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha has carved out a huge empire from Nubia through the Levant.\n\nIn this new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial, and new dogmas will rise in their place. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Asia and Africa, and The Heart of Darkness, beckon that their songs may also be heard, in the Concert of Europe. #bold Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.#!"
