 colonization.13.name:0 "Colonization - Missionaries Accepted"
 colonization.13.desc:0 "Great news! [colonize_target.GetName] seems to have listened to reason and converted to the [colonizing_faith.GetAdjective] faith. With this conversion, many of the native tribes have followed suit, attempting to adapt better to our ways and customs."

 colonization.14.name:0 "Colonization - Infrastructure Raided"
 colonization.14.desc:0 "A massive attack led by tribal chiefs of [colonize_target.GetName] has targeted the site of a major railroad designed to connect our various settlements in the region.

 colonization.14.desc.2:0 "A massive attack led by tribal chiefs of [colonize_target.GetName] has targeted the site of a major settlement, burning down many administrative centers and causing the colonists to flee for their lives.
