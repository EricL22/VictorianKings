 colonization.1.name:0 "Influx of Settlers"
 colonization.1.desc:0 "Recently there has been a surge in people settling down within the country. Claiming allegiance to the flag of [actor.GetTitledFirstName], they make it no secret that they intend to completely integrate my realm into their own, under the guize of civilizing barbarians!"
 colonization.9.desc:0 "Our colonists have been successful in asserting control over the untamed lands of [the_colonized.GetFullName], and with sufficient infrastructure established, the region has been annexed into our growing empire."
 colonization.9.a:0 "Another wayward people enlightened."
 colonization.10.name:0 "Colonization Complete"
 colonization.10.desc:0 "The colonists from the [colonizer_title.GetName] have grown to the point where they have outnumbered our native population. Combined with the large amount of infrastructure now being built, and government military forces permanently garrisoned in the area, they have stripped away what little sovereignty yet remains of our nation."
 colonization.10.a:0 "We have lost our independence..."

 colonization.13.name:0 "Colonization - Missionaries Accepted"
 colonization.13.desc:0 "Great news! [colonize_target.GetName] seems to have listened to reason and converted to the [colonizing_faith.GetAdjective] faith. With this conversion, many of the native tribes have followed suit, attempting to adapt better to our ways and customs."

 colonization.14.name:0 "Colonization - Infrastructure Raided"

 colonization.14.desc.2:0 "A massive attack led by tribal chiefs of [colonize_target.GetName] has targeted the site of a major settlement, burning down many administrative centers and causing the colonists to flee for their lives.

 colonization.18.name:0 "Colonization - No Local Guides"  #####Decrease progress by 1
 colonization.18.desc:0 "We have not been able to convince or compel the natives of the region to serve as guides. Due to this mishap, it will take much longer to stabilize the wildling region, not knowing where their bases are and not knowing the terrain."

 colonization.102.desc:0 "With the arrival of men from the [colonizer_title.GetName], there has been a marked increase in the industrialization of our lands, completely overrunning any food sources or other resources we have derived from there for generations.
